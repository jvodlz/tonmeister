# Tonmeister
A desktop guitar tuner app. 

Inspired by my need for a quick and accessible way to help tune my guitar, I thought, why not make a little project out of it? And here we are â€” a handy tool that makes guitar tuning a bit easier for me, and hopefully for you as well.

## Features
- __Standard Tuning for Guitar__ - Supports standard EADGBE tuning
- __Loop Playback__ - Allows users to play a selected pitch on loop

# Getting Started
Download _Tonmeister.exe_ and run the application. 

### _Loop Playback_
The note will begin to loop only after the loop option is activated and a new note is played. 

Any note currently being played will not be looped. To loop the same note, simply play it again.

## Upcoming Features
- Support alternative guitar tunings (full-step, half-step, etc.)
- Improved GUI design
